                                   Real-Time Driver Drowsiness Detection System



PROJECT INFORMATION


This project aims to develop a comprehensive real-time driver drowsiness detection system using OpenCV, which monitors a driver's face through live video streaming to detect signs of drowsiness, such as frequent blinking or yawning. The system enhances road safety by providing an immediate alert through a beam alarm when signs of drowsiness are detected, ensuring prompt action to prevent potential accidents. This solution integrates live video analysis with real-time auditory alerts, making it an effective and proactive approach to promoting driver awareness and reducing road risks.

AIMS


1.Face Detection:
Use OpenCV to detect the driver's face in real-time using Haar Cascades or a pre-trained deep learning model.

2.Eye and Yawn Detection:
Detect eye blinks and yawns to assess drowsiness levels. This can be achieved using facial landmarks to analyze eye and mouth regions.

3.Real-Time Alerts:
Implement a system to provide alerts (visual or auditory) when drowsiness is detected to help the driver stay alert.
